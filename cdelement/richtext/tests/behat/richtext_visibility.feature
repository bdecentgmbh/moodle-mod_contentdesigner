    Given I am on the "Demo content" "contentdesigner activity" page logged in as teacher1
    And I click on "Content editor" "link"
    And I click on ".contentdesigner-addelement .fa-plus" "css_element"
    And I click on ".elements-list li[data-element=richtext]" "css_element" in the ".modal-body" "css_element"
    And I set the field "Rich Text Content" to "<b style='color: #7c7cff; background-color: #ffffff;'>Hard to read</b>"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Title" to "Richtext 01"
    And I click on "Create element" "button"
    And I click on "Content Designer" "link"
    Then I should see "Hard to read" in the ".chapter-elements-list li .richtext-content" "css_element"
    Then ".chapter-elements-list li .richtext-content" "css_element" should exist
