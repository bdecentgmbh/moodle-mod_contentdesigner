1. **Course**

    Select the specific course from the list of available courses that includes the video for the Videotime activity. This ensures that the video is correctly linked to the relevant course content, offering learners a smooth and consistent learning experience.

    - **The course will only appear in this option if the Videotime module has been added to that course.**

    - **When the user is not enrolled in the selected course that has the VideoTime activity, only a message will be displayed without the "Enrol me" button informing the user to enroll in the course. If self-enrollment is enabled, the "Enrol me" button will be available, allowing the user to enroll directly.**

2. **Videotime Modules**

    Select the specific activity from the list of available Videotime modules. This allows you to choose the relevant video-based activity that will be linked to the course, ensuring that the correct video content is presented to the learners for that activity.

3. **Mandatory**

    This setting determines whether the Videotime activity is required for learners to complete before proceeding to the next activity.
    - **Yes:** The learner must watch the video in full before moving on to the next section or module in the course.
    - **No:** The learner can skip the video and continue with the course module without watching it.

## Table of contents
A Table of Contents (ToC) in Content Designer is a navigational element that provides an overview of the structure of a chapter. It lists all the sections, chapters, and key content elements within the course, allowing learners to quickly locate and navigate to specific parts of the material.
