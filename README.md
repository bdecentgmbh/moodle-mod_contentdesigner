# Content Designer

Create engaging and interactive content, directly in your Moodle course. Content Designer is developed specifically for instructional designers and collaborative content creation. The architecture of Content Designer was inspired by content management systems and built around the workflow of instructional designer: starting with a high-level concept, then broken down into individual elements and then adding content for each part of the concept. Content Designer’s chapter structure allows simultaneous collaborative editing of contents. 

In Content Designer, content is organised in chapters. Chapters then contain elements, such as headings, paragraphs or rich text. Each element comes with customization options for appearance, animations and responsiveness. Elements can be styled globally according to their type to match the organization’s branding guidelines and create a visually appealing look. This architecture makes it much easier to maintain a consistent look and feel. At the same time, content creation is easier and faster. The separation of content, layout and style is perfectly suited for quality management tasks and corporate design compliance.

At the end of each activity, the outro element visually indicates the end of the activity. This event is also used to trigger activity completion.

The dedicated h5p element gives teachers a great way to incorporate interactions into their content. For many content types, students can be required to complete the interaction before they can proceed.

# Moodle release support

This plugin is maintained for the two most recent major releases of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.

# Translating this plugin
